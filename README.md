# Business-Analysis-Projects

Business analysts are change agents and are needed in almost every part of a business or a corporation, especially in the tech or IT industries. They must be able to recognize the need for change, analyze change requests, and implement beneficial changes for their respective clients and stakeholders.

This portion of the repository will be used to track my work on BA projects in which I have experience, either as the lead BA or a supporting BA.

Also take note that some sensitive information will be concealed and not released until I have the client's permission to do so out of respect for their privacy. As I continue on this amazing trip, projects that I have completed will be given fictitious names.

Cheers
